Delaware International Logistics (DIL) is a shipping Management Company that is in charge of the logistics associated with the shipping of cargo by ship. DIL operates along with other companies for the packing, moving and shipping of cargo, and nowadays offers its services to five countries around the world. Currently the reservation, payment and management of the services is totally manual, by phone, email, fax or/and using paper-based documents, which makes the process slow and error prone. Furthermore, the actual system lack of an effective way to communicate the services provided by the company to their actual customers and potential customers around the world. To address this shortcoming of the current system, we propose a DIL web-base system that integrates the registration of users of the system (customers and employees), the booking of shipping services, the generation of shipping orders, the management of a shipping orders and the tracking of bookings and shipping orders, all in an automated way. The Web-based system will support the main activities of DIL described above, and will be a communication medium for customers around the world having interests in the services provided by the company. Furthermore, the Web-based system will provide an easy and simple way for employees access the information and services managed by IDL, and it will support the organization of shipping orders with the provider companies associated with IDL.
